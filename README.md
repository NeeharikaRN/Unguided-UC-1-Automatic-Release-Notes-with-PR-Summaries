# Unguided-UC-1-Automatic-Release-Notes-with-PR-Summaries

The goal is to automatically create structured release notes for every release — preventing missing or inconsistent documentation and ensuring all stakeholders have a clear overview of changes without manual intervention.

By completing this activity, you have:
1) Implemented automated release note generation from merged pull requests using GitHub Actions
2) Ensured structured, readable release notes with PR titles, labels, and authors
3) Reduced manual effort required to compile and maintain release documentation
4) Created a lightweight, reusable CI workflow that can be applied to any repository to maintain consistent release records.
